# Lookahead Trainer
Legacy Project (high school project), ended progress on version 0.2.0

Rubik's Cube Speedsolving Trainer. TPS is everything for a speedsolver; to mitigate pauses between moves, a slow but steady turning pace can cause dramatic improvements to speed. This is largely known as "lookahead". Lookahead Trainer is a metronome-based practice method with extra features such as timer and BPM selector.

### Main Features:
- Sound-cued Metronome to indicate turn tick
- BPM selector
- calculated Estimated Completion Time for F2L stage (based on BPM)
- Key Timer (hold SPACE to start, any key to end)
- Time Log to see progress or session history

### Things I demonstrate:
- NATURAL animation of several UI components
  - without the use of imports or packages, all animations are variable/logic based. Ease-in and Ease-out animations were done by assigning velocity and acceleration values to moving components.
- Reactive UI
  - movement of mouse will interrupt animation playback moving either up or down.
